## Devlog
If we think of a game as a keyboard, the scene would be the keyboard. It’s what the user sees as a whole when looking at a game. GameObjects are the keycaps of the scene. These are what makes up the scene and what the user interacts with when playing a game. Components are the electrical circuits that make the GameObjects work. Without components, GameObjects will have no functionality and will only be there for looks.
